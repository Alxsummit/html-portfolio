  An oddball family of employees at supersized megastore Cloud 9 tackles the
  day-to-day grind of rabid bargain hunters, riot-causing sales and nap-worthy
  training sessions. Stalwart employee Amy is just trying to hold it all
  together despite the best efforts of her daftly clueless manager Glen and his
  iron-fisted assistant Dina. Rounding out the crew is new hire Jonah, a dreamy
  dreamer, sardonic Garrett, ambitious Mateo and sweet young mother-to-be
  Cheyenne. From bright-eyed newbies to seen-it-all veterans, bumbling seasonal
  hires and in-it-for-life managers, they're all going to get through another
  day -- together.

  Row. Michael holds up a bank to get himself incarcerated alongside his brother
  in Fox River State Penitentiary, then sets in motion a series of elaborate
  plans to break Lincoln out and prove his innocence. Once out of jail, their
  perils aren't over -- the brothers must flee to escape recapture and battle an
  intricate political conspiracy that puts everyone's life at risk.
